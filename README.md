# Introduction to XProc

This repository contains slides, software, and examples for the half-day workshop "Introduction to XProc"
held at the TEI Conference and Members' Meeting 2022 in Newcastle, UK

## Abstract

XProc is an XML based programming language for processing documents in pipelines. Version 1.0 of the language was
published as W3C Recommendation in 2010. The final version of the next version, XProc 3.0, is expected to be published
as community report in late 2022.

This half-day workshop will teach the participants the basic concepts of an XProc processing pipeline (pipelines, steps,
ports) and practice their application in a series of excercises. The overall goal of the workshop is to enable to
participants to write pipelines that chain common markup manipulation tasks such as loading, transforming, validating
that can be used as building blocks for more elaborate steps or as one-off scripts in data maintenance.

From the participants the workshop requires a general understanding of XML document editing and basic knowledge of
XPath. The material requirements are a projector and laptops to follow through with the examples given in the
workshop. Any operating system with a recent Java Runtime is sufficient.
